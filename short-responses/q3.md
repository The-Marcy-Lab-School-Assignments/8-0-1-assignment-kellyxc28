# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
"Static assets" are HTML, CSS, and JS files that are unchanged, or their contents are presented as is. They are stored in the `dist` folder, which is in the `frontend` folder. 

To generate them, we first need to import the `path` module. From this, we can use `path.join()` to create an absolute path to the `dist` folder. The next steps are to import the `express` module to then use `express.static(<path>)`. 

Lastly, we make sure the app is using the middleware function (express) by doing `app.use(<middleware express function name here>)`.

Great response! However, the second half doesn't fully answer the question. You explained how to serve static assets from the back end, but didn't address how to generate them. To do this, you need to run npm run build in your front-end directory.
