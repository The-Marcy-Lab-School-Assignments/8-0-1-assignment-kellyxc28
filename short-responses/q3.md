# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
"Static assets" are HTML, CSS, and JS files that are unchanged, or their contents are presented as is. They are stored in the `dist` folder, which is in the `frontend` folder. 

To generate them, we first need to import the `path` module. From this, we can use `path.join()` to create an absolute path to the `dist` folder. The next steps are to import the `express` module to then use `express.static(<path>)`. 

Lastly, we make sure the app is using the middleware function (express) by doing `app.use(<middleware express function name here>)`.
